# Roweflix Recommender
A home-made movie recommendation system built using Python, The Movie Database API, and Large Language Model/Natural Language Processing Techniques. The system combines traditional keyword searching techniques using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency and more cutting edge semantic search capabilities to provide movie recommendations based on an input search.

The system allows you to search via two methods. The first is via movie name, where we will then match your search to the most likely movie in our database and use the subsequent metadata for recommendations. The second method allows for inputting longer text and specific descriptions to search through the database. Both provide awesome results!

Example Search (Movie Name) - Avengers: Endgame

Example Search (Description) - Movies where good fights against evil in an epic showdown to determine the fate of the universe and save their loved ones.

Bonus Information:

I present to you, Roweflix Recommender. A streamllit app using the movie recommender class in the attached repo to allow user interation and provide a front-end interface for model usage. The visualization includes searching, dynamic creation and formatting of results, as well as a tooltip that provides movie metadata information when you hover over a movie.

Special thanks to The Movie Database for such an amazing movie database that we can use. Feel free to go create your own app and start using the API here: https://www.themoviedb.org/
